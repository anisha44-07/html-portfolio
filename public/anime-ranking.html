<h1>The Best Anime's According to Anisha</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Anime of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Naruto</h3>
<p> When i comes to naruto people say it's way too long to start which indeed it is, but it's worth the watch! Just remove the filler episode and you are good to go. <br >
<br />It's a motivational one so you are going to love it for sure</p>
<h3>Attack On Titans</h3>
<p> This was actually the First Anime i watched along with my bestfriend and it's mindblowing!! and somehow hard to understand, soo if you are ready to use your brains do check it out! Hope you would be able to understand it because it requires good analytical skills to connect the dots... <br />
<br />This Anime requires brains to watch</p>
<h3>Jujutsu Kaisen</h3>
<p> To be honest i liked this Anime only for Gojo Satoru. Man's got amazing, The Perfect Blue eyes an anime character can ever have. The animators have done a real good job on him. Later on comes with more and more attactive characters.<br />
 <br />Girls this Anime is going to keep you hooked ;) </p>
